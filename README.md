## 1. Project Overview

This project is a cloud-native microservices application deployed on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** and re-themed as a **Best Buy–style online store**.

The original architecture comes from the “Algonquin Pet Store (On Steroids)” sample, but in this project:

- The **branding, UI text, and styling** were updated to match a Best Buy–inspired look and feel.
- The **products, images, and colors** were customized away from “pet toys” toward an electronics retail experience.
- The same microservices architecture (product, order, makeline, RabbitMQ, MongoDB) is reused under a new Best Buy scenario.

This project demonstrates:

- Containerization (Docker)
- Microservices architecture
- Kubernetes deployments (AKS)
- StatefulSets & persistent storage
- Scaling & resilience
- A fully themed Best Buy–style front-end and admin UI
